  "caricature_prompt": "Draw a caricature of a person with an exaggerated forehead and cheekbones, holding a rock climbing rope in one hand and a laptop in the other. They have a serious expression on their face as they code away in a cozy kitchen. Use bold contours and minimal detail to create a clean line art style that is suitable for robotic arm drawing. The person should appear playful and energetic, with the climbing rope and kitchen setting suggesting their various hobbies and interests.",
